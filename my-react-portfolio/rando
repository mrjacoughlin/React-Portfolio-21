                      I worked with my team to design this Multi-page website to
                      help parents cope with the challenges of remote education.
                      This Application allows the User to search for educational
                      resources using Education Data Portal and YouTube Data
                      APIs. The User can search for schools in their area by
                      State and Zip, while also selecting specific criteria,
                      such as YouTube channels: Khan Academy, Smithsonian and
                      more.

                Working with my team, we created an easy-to-use online banking
                app that features login functionality and server-side account
                storage. We used Passport for Password encryption, UUID to
                generate unique ID, and utilized MYSQLas well as Sequilized and
                Workbench. The name of this app is a combination of the first
                letter of everyone’s name who collaborated on this project.
